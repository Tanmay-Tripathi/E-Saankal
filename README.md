Designed and developed an Android and IoT project that enables users to open a solenoid door lock through a mobile application.

Implemented a solenoid lock control system using a Raspberry Pi and established a communication channel between the Pi and a
mobile application through socket communication.


# Android

# Backend
Python server was used in the backend that acted as a bridge between the app and the pi to control the lock.
